AI-generated text might exhibit patterns that deviate from human-like syntax.\n\n* Vocabulary Complexity:\nMeasure the complexity of vocabulary used in the text. AI models might generate text with either overly complex or simplistic language compared to typical human writing.\n* Semantic Coherence:\nAssess the coherence of sentences in terms of semantic meaning. Human-generated text tends to have a more natural flow of ideas and coherent structure.\n* Common Phrases and Idioms:\nCheck for the use of common phrases, idioms, and cultural references that are typically found in human communication. AI models may struggle to mimic these accurately.\n* Context Understanding:\nAnalyze the text for evidence of a deep understanding of context. Human writers often incorporate a broader contextual understanding into their writing that AI models may find challenging to replicate.\n* Creativity and Originality:\nAssess the level of creativity and originality in the text. Human writers often bring a unique perspective and creativity to their writing that may be distinct from AI-generated content.\n* Length and Structure:\nExamine the length and structure of sentences and paragraphs. AI models might produce text with consistent or repetitive structures that differ from the varied structures often found in human writing.\n* Consistency in Style:\nEvaluate the consistency in writing style throughout the text. Human writers may exhibit variations in style, tone, and expression, while AI-generated text might be more consistent.\n* Awareness of Current Events:\nCheck for references to recent events or time-sensitive information. AI models might not have up-to-date information or an understanding of current events.\n* Metaphors and Figurative Language:\nAnalyze the use of metaphors, similes, and other forms of figurative language. Human writers often use these elements to convey meaning in a nuanced way.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To combine these together, we can have a layer that combines our smaller parallel nodes and gives them different weight.
